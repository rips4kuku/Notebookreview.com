my database name is test and tables are dailyupdate,signup(for user validation),user(for admin validation) and checkout.

I have given comments in some php file. Its a time consuming project so I have tried my level best to get as much as work done.
Below files give the specific details about the work I have done to make this website:
1)Entrance.html
This is my home page which contains two entrance one for general users another for admin user
I have used a clock that shows current time using javascript on this page and logo of my website.
2)adminloginform.html
It is just for admin login. Admin username and password is already stored in database table and he himself should know it.
if he forgot his username or password then I have used a link on the page by which he can send email to database admin to get his username and password.
3)dailyupdate.html
Once the admin logged in he can add the new products with it detail using this form.
I have used JavaScript that show an error message if you forgot to enter any detail of product.
Once admin logged in he can see any other page of the website and make changes into it.
4)sigup.html
This is a form for user login by which user can logged in into my site and see the products and purchase them.
I have used CSS that tell user where he is during log in.
to log in he has to register first.
I have created a database table which store all the information of user and give him login access after complete registration.
I have also used JavaScript validation here and setfocus on first field of form.
5)usersection.html
This is my home page once both user and admin logged in and before that my home page is entrance.html
on this page I have put search goggle search bar which helps you to compare products on my site with other site.
It will also search products of my site on goggle but I have not yet hosted my website on register server so I dont have any hostname yet.
I have put links on all the product of my laptop by its company.So, once you click on them you have a dropdown menu by which you can search the product 
according your choice of model and then you can use add to cart button on the product to add them to the cart.
Once you add them to the cart you can checkout your order by clicking on checkout button where you have a form named checkout.html
you have to fill the form by mentioning all the detail like credit-card number, email, cvv which help you to purchase the product.
Once you checked out successfully your credential will be stored in our database table name checkout which helps the admins to deliver the products 
to your address.
I have also used one homepage button by which you can directly go to the homepage for purchasing another laptop.
you can also contact us directly to buy laptops and we can try to give you the best deal that attracts the customers like you towards our website
which help to expand business globally.
6)dealofday.html
you can click on deal of the day on my home page which shows the daily deal.
You just have to click on the name of company on drop-down menu and it will show the best deal of the day.
7)Logout
I have put logout button on every page of my website by which user or admin can logged out at any-time from any webpage and closed his session.

Thank you.
